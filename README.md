# ancient-places-eda
A data analysis project into historical sites across the globe using data from Pleiades

## Scribbles 

A few data sources are places and names. Names refer to a specific temporal settlement at a broader geographic location, whereas places refer to an historic, excavated site. For example, Jericho is a broader location but has 20+ different names representing different settlements emerging on the same site throughout history or associated references in historical documents. Jericho the site is referred to by 20+ names including Tall as-Sultan, Tell el-Sultan, Hierichous, Jericho etc.
As below, the link between the two datasets is the placeID or pid (in names sheet(with longer link name)) and simply id in the places sheet.
